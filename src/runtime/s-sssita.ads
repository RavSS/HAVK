------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--  This package provides a simple, default implementation of a function that
--  returns a pointer to a secondary stack for use in single-threaded
--  applications. It is not suitable for multi-threaded applications.
--
--  The function defined in this package is used when the following two
--  conditions are met:
--    1) No user-defined implementation has been provided. That is, the
--       symbol __gnat_get_sec_stack is not exported by the user's code.
--    2) No tasking is used. When tasking is used, __gnat_get_secondary_stack
--       is resolved by libgnarl.a (that contains a thread-safe implementation
--       of the secondary stack), so that the single-threaded version is not
--       included in the final executable.

pragma Restrictions (No_Elaboration_Code);
--  We want to guarantee the absence of elaboration code because the binder
--  does not handle references to this package.

package System.Secondary_Stack.Single_Task is

   function Get_Sec_Stack return SS_Stack_Ptr;
   pragma Export (C, Get_Sec_Stack, "__gnat_get_secondary_stack");
   --  Return the pointer of the secondary stack to be used for single-threaded
   --  applications, as expected by System.Secondary_Stack.

end System.Secondary_Stack.Single_Task;
